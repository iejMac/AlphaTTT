Task:
Make a good game visualization TOOL

Modules to look at:
Pygame, Pygame_GUI

1. Easy to load, swap, and make changes to agent params
2. 2 modes:
    a. game mode where it's just a simple GUI for playing models against each other
    b. debug mode where you can visualize game metrics and see what models are "thinking" if applicable
3. Easy to add visualization metrics (defined in approach folder according to template) to see during gameplay f.e.:
  - graph of model certainty over time
  - heat map of interesting moves for players
  - some sort of mcts explorer??? (hard) (maybe separate script or sth)'

4. 1 command setup (!!!)
5. Logging system so people can input a username and commit their games to the database (needs to log if playing against human, player or whatever) (!!!)
