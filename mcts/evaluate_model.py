'''
This scirpt calculates a metric that shows if the model thinks human moves are good.
Assuming consistent improvement and that human level ability is between random play and super-human ability, we should be able to obvserve an increase in this metric as the model approaches human ability followed by a smaller decrease when it surpasses human ability.
